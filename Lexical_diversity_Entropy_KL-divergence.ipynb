It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body.

Friday\\'s New York Times reported that this group definitely is more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively enough) The NYT reported that besides complaining that the government was not conservative enough they have: asserted that the (approx numbr) Shiites in the Kingdom are apostates a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law brings the death penalty Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin) isn\\'t he Ilyess? called for severe punishment of the numbr or so women who drove in public a while back to protest the ban on women driving The guy from the group who said this Abdelhamoud al Toweijri said that these women should be fired from their jobs jailed and branded as prostitutes Is this what you want to see happen Ilyess? I\\'ve heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving has no basis in the Qur\\'an the ahadith etc Yet these folks not only like the ban they want these women falsely called prostitutes?

[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox [EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire It is [EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism [EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian Apostolic There was however a higher percentage of non Gregorian Armenians in Cilicia closer to the Mediterranean in Adana Marash Aintab etc [EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia [EE] did not speak any Armenian but used Turkish in their everyday lives This is not true While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in certain areas of Cilician Armenia most all Armenians spoke Armenian In fact Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure most all Armenians especially men also knew Turkish in order to function in larger society [EE] My question is given so many separations in the Armenian community what [EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian [EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated religion [EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn\\'t even speak [EE] Armenian I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the [EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian [EE] consciousness The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian regardless of the specific branch of Christianity they professed The resultant Armenian nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution Even at the later stages of WWI and after the genocide many Armenians who were converted to Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems This practice continued well into the numbrs by Ataturk in parallel with the policy of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism Many of these converted Armenians ironically in order to stay alive were staunch Moslems [EE] Any information will be appreciated You answered your own question!

If the user is the government then the funding's not separate from the government If the user is the buyer what's the service? Keeping the key for me? No thanks I don't need and won't buy their service! Not telling everybody my key? Sounds like blackmail! If the user is the manufacturer does the user have a choice about buying? The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it which is fine I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key! Face it the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want The only people who want it are the government not the users What you're really talking about is either the government paying for the service up front or per year either from general taxes or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips or on an indirect tax (forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent ) I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from your serial number especially if the escrow is a government agency Here in New Jersey we have lots of people willing to provide that sort of services for user fees There are people willing to keep your store from burning down for a small monthly fee though sometimes people refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium there are people who will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee Something could scratch the paint after all And what a shame if your Clipper key got out! # Pray for peace; Bill # Bill Stewart numbr numbr numbr numbr email AT&T Bell Labs numbrMnumbr Holmdel NJ # No I'm from New Jersey I only work in cyberspace # White House Commect Line numbr numbr numbr numbr fax numbr numbr numbr numbr \",\n",

This is somewhat unlikely given that our brains ultimately are encoded in numbr chromosomes worth of genetic material much of which isn\\'t used One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation but (again as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see object X then perform action Y \\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see and what conclusions to draw from it\\'s experience The other problem with algorithms is their instability Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side effects but patients still seem remarkably stable ) Also neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s code? The next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace \\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice ) Presumably the materialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of chemical reaction The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so a computer won\\'t see colour because the chemistry is different Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances So why do we see colour? > >However such a view is actually a nonsolution How should minds be >able to act as observers feel pain and pleasure and issue >commands any better than the brain? Moreover how do the interactions >occur? A bit of idle speculation If I remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction with two processes acting on it The first process has been called \\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\') is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation and is well known The second process called various things such as \\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\') and is more mysterious It is usually said to occur when a \\'measurement\\' takes place although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs When it does occur the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something else \\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X \\' It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case part X is simply the wavefunction Note though that we\\'d need more than U to explain R ) Anyway I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X There seems to be some link between consciousness and R in that we never see linear superpositions of anything although there are alternative explainations for this I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X but since this is only speculation that won\\'t matter too much : ) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics I\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now if that\\'s OK with you : ) > > >Petri Kevin Anthoney email Don\\'t believe anything you read in sig files ',\n",

Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth Amendment As to your \"Then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because the award of damages in involuntary\" claim you\\'re at least partially right Faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer) In these cases the \"sale\" has already taken place and is irreversible and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and (b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood Both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere but neither is relevant to cases like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and _can_ be reversed undone (i e prevented from happening at all) by order of the court In these types of cases all the court has to do is require that the potential victim\\'s property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually acceptable price There is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding It can leave that operation up to the parties themselves >> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the >> business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided? >> (If so I\\'ve been miseducated I always thought that the courts were >> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done ) > > Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive In cases like _Boomer_ they\\'re simply a cost of doing business The fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose property rights they\\'d be violating via the operation of their plant There\\'s nothing punitive or unjust about it >> (numbr) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged >> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid >> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and >> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to >> not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who >> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts >> [wdstarr] > > Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire > set of possessions to wronged person?

created for use by MS Windows numbr numbr numbr numbr applications is documented in the MS Windows Programmer\\'s Reference guide This guide is intended as a clearify some wording of the specifications and to put forth a recommendation among the various alternatives Please send updates corrections suggestions and revisions to me Please thank me for writing this on my own time by keeping my name with the document Thank you for your respect This document Copyright numbr by Thomas B Kinsman If desired a PostScript version of this document is available This information is free You get more than what you pay for Don\\'t sue me if I\\'m wrong OVERVIEW The DIB image file format is intended to be a \"Device Independent Bitmap\" file format (What Microsoft means by \"Device Independent\" is unclear to me ) Four pixel resolutions are supported: numbr bit numbr bit numbr bit and numbr bit pixels These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM or Little Endian) systems If you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte swap all short and long integer values By convention DIB images end in the extension \" BMP\" This is because March numbr numbr numbr they are a super set of earlier \"bitmap image files\" Consequently you will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as \"BMP\" files Since DIB images files are a super set there are three \"flavors\" of DIB images: o DOS DIB images These are the recommended convention and the form which I will describe how to create They are intended for applications running under MS Windows numbr numbr in a DOS environment o OS numbr DIB images My understanding is that these are the flavor of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager o Old style Bitmap images March numbr numbr numbr DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS The DOS DIB images consist of: numbr A \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file as a DIB file This header also gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data numbr A \"BITMAPINFOHEADER\" image header which specifies the image attributes numbr An optional palette of colors used by the image If it exists this may contain numbr numbr or numbr entries Each entry is a Windows RGBQUAD structure numbr The image data itself The OS numbr DIB images consist of: numbr The same \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file as a DIB file This header also gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data numbr A \"BITMAPCOREHEADER\" image header which specifies the image attributes numbr An optional palette of colors used by the image Again if this exists it may contain numbr numbr or numbr entries Each entry is a Windows RGBTRIPLE structure numbr The image data itself The Old Style image bitmap consists of: numbr Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a BITMAPCOREHEADER Which header type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value numbr An optional color palette This palette may be composed of either Windows RGBQUAD structures (if the header was a BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the header was a BITMAPCOREHEADER) numbr The image data itself CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward steps The headers need to be created and then written to the file These header structures are defined in the MS Windows numbr numbr \"windows h\" include file Palette information needs to be stored for images that are not numbr bit images The five general steps are: numbr Filling in the BITMAPFILEHEADER and the BITMAPINFOHEADER structures the basic image information numbr If the image is a numbr bit numbr bit or an numbr bit image creating the color palette of RGBQUADS numbr Calculating the total file size and putting this information in March numbr numbr numbr the \"bfSize\" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER numbr Calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the file and putting this in the \"bfOffBits\" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER numbr Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER the BITMAPINFOHEADER the color palette and the image data (in that order) The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft C type defined keywords The following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with MicroSoft C _______________________________________ | | | Type defined keywords in MicroSoft C | |______________________________________| | typedef | meaning | |_________|____________________________| | BYTE | unsigned character | | WORD | two byte unsigned integer | | DWORD | four byte unsigned integer| |_________|____________________________| March numbr numbr numbr THE BITMAPFILEHEADER This structure is defined in \"windows h\" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { WORD bfType; DWORD bfSize; WORD bfReservednumbr; WORD bfReservednumbr; DWORD bfOffBits; } BITMAPFILEHEADER; The \"bfType\" field is the two ascii characters \\'B\\' and \\'M\\' This serves to identify the file as a DIB image file On an intel byte ordered machine (IBM or a compatible) this constant can be formed in C as the quantity (\\'M\\' << numbr | \\'B\\') == numbrxnumbrdnumbr on an intel system The \"bfSize\" field is the total size of the file For our purposes this field is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD plus the number of bytes of image data If the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form this value can be calculated ahead of time Otherwise this field needs to be filled in later Both the \"bfReservednumbr\" and the \"bfReservednumbr\" fields are always set to zero The \"bfOffBits\" field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file For our purposes this field should be set to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD This works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists March numbr numbr numbr THE BITMAPINFOHEADER This structure is defined in \"windows h\" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{ DWORD biSize; DWORD biWidth; DWORD biHeight; WORD biPlanes; WORD biBitCount; DWORD biCompression; DWORD biSizeImage; DWORD biXPelsPerMeter; DWORD biYPelsPerMeter; DWORD biClrUsed; DWORD biClrImportant; } BITMAPINFOHEADER; The \"biSize\" field is set to the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure itself When reading the image file this value is what is used to determine that the image contains a BITMAPINFOHEADER and not a BITMAPCOREHEADER The \"biWidth\" field is the width of the image in image pixels The \"biHeight\" field is the height of the image in image lines The \"biPlanes\" field should always be set to numbr This data is written out as if there was one color plane The \"biBitCount\" field is the bit depth of the image This must be either numbr numbr numbr or numbr depending on the bit depth of the image data The \"biCompression\" field tells how the image data is compressed if it is compressed DIB images support two forms of run length encoding However I have never seen any images which use it and don\\'t know yet how it works Set this field to zero (long zero or numbrL) to indicate that the data is not compressed All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure may be set to zero A requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be \"biClrUsed\" For numbr bit and numbr bit images this field indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the image contains \"biClrUsed\" colors If you are using only numbr colors with an numbr bit image then you may only want to save numbr of the possible numbr palette entries Generally set this field to zero March numbr numbr numbr COLOR PALETTES Each entry of a color palette is a RGBQUAD structure The RGBQUAD structure is defined in the \"windows h\" include file as: typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { BYTE rgbBlue; BYTE rgbGreen; BYTE rgbRed; BYTE rgbReserved; } RGBQUAD; The \"rgbReserved\" field is always zero For each color used the amount of Blue Green and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file A value of zero in the \"rgbBlue\" \"rgbGreen\" or \"rgbRed\" fields indicates that that particular component does not contribute to the color composition A value of numbr in any of these fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition IMAGE DATA There are three surprises about the ordering of image data in DIB image file The creator of this format was determined to be creative and certainly was Within the image data each line written out is padded to the next four byte quantity So if you had an numbr bit image which was only one pixel wide you still have to write out four bytes for every image line The number of bytes per line can be calculated as: bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix bit_depth + numbr ) numbr numbr; or in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure bytes_per_line = (biWidth biBitCount + numbr ) numbr numbr; When writing out your image data you must write it out bottom line first The bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file For numbr bit numbr bit and numbr bit images information is written as you would expect One bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte Four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte Eight bit images are written one pixel per byte Twenty four bit images are written three bytes per pixel However for numbr bit images the information must be written out in the order blue green red While most image file formats write data out in March numbr numbr numbr an \"RGB\" ordering a DIB image file writes the data out in an \"BGR\" ordering SUMMARY This should provide enough information to create DIB images from applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines If you find out any more about DIB images please pass the information on to me so that I can modify this document accordingly March numbr numbr Thomas B Kinsman Rochester

Could it be that they didn\\'t have any explosives or similar munitions? I just don\\'t buy what the ATF and FBI have been saying Hopefully the truth will come out Here\\'s something noteworthy: after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred just one explosion The media said that this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off I don\\'t think this was the case My brother and I noticed that this so called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited We figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\" looked and sounded Obviously it wasn\\'t due to something like TNT dynamite or Cnumbr I have seen a propane explosion before the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this Also I noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day Isn\\'t it curious that the ATF wasn\\'t very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed? Many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and or wounded by grenades thrown by the BDs Earlier when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents they said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN\\'T READY TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS Now why is this? Does the ATF have something to hide? Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire What is the cause of death exactly? NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS What is certain is this: ATF agents did throw grenades into the compound As a matter of fact Mr Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer\\'s visits to the compound Later on the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don\\'t know if it was a dud or a spent one btw) to the ATF How much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear? At this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents Wouldn\\'t it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades rockets or explosives in the rubble? The ATF would sure have egg on their face then Note that the ATF is doing the initial sweep of the rubble The FBI and the Texas Rangers won\\'t investigate until the ATF is done This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to make sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if you know what I mean I\\'m probably being a little paranoid here but if I am I have could reason to be Recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades Also recall that early on the ATF had denied that their agents used grenades on the BDs Someone is lying here Scott Kennedy Brewer and Patriot Before: \"David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the Bible through the barrel of a gun \" ATF spokesman After: \"[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun \" Me ',\n",

This is something I\\'ve always found a little curious I\\'ve never quite understood the trinity thing On the one hand Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate But at the same time he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son\" First question is if Jesus was God in human form how could he really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary so to speak then it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the human father son relationship While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s qualities he is not the father They are still two separite entities To try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong In that case Jesus and God aren\\'t the same On the other hand if their relationship isn\\'t the same as the human father son relationship but Jesus is actually God incarnate then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was He\\'s just God manifesting himself as Jesus At least this is how I\\'m seeing it Can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? Getting back to the original question what is the great price that Jesus paid to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would rise again in numbr days and then ascend back to heaven I have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity His earthly body may have been killed but then so what? He suffered a few hours of physical pain but then there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more The fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to Jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice I suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many Christians on this net To those people please accept my sincere apologies It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ But I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious [Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together First your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one (In this group it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something ) You seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother I consider that terrible heresy though some people react less violently The Virgin Birth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility But it doesn\\'t imply that God\\'s sperm was involved Indeed one (though by no means the only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material Second Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father In a Trinitarian context the term Son refers to the eternal Logos who is a part of God The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth Jesus is the incarnation of the Son So his sonness isn\\'t specifically a result of being incarnated Rather it\\'s the Son who was incarnated clh] ',\n",

Do people pray to statues of Mary? It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself I\\'m sure) believe Mary was sinless? Wow I hoped to spend the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about Tongues (I\\'m reading \"Charismatic Chaos\") I guess I\\'ll study Tongues in parallel with reading this news group Any help you can give me will be appreciated [I don\\'t think the issue is so much that people are more educated than you (though it may well be that they are) as that they come from a different tradition than yours This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants Catholics generally believe that Mary was sinless Protestants do not The issue comes down to different sources of authority Protestants generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine Since this isn\\'t in the Bible (except in passages that no one would understand in this way if they didn\\'t already believe it) Protestants don\\'t accept it Catholics see continuing revelation through the Church though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible I interpret your posting not as a call for yet another argument about whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am not prepared to see newed here) but as a sign of being interested in learning about traditions other than your own Catholics are of course a major one but by no means the only one I generally consider the major traditions to be Catholic Orthodox and various subsets of Protestantism Within Protestantism it\\'s a matter of how finely you want to cut things These days I think the major division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those who don\\'t There are also a number of major historical traditions but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur I\\'d identify the major Protestant traditions as: Lutheran Reformed Anglican (they\\'re sort of halfway between Catholic and Protestant) Wesleyan Baptist Holiness Pentecostal Church of Christ But there are a number of others Historical distinctions tend not to be so important among the liberal churches anymore and I think current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\" perspective But differences among these various traditions are still quite marked I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book on church history Anyone who wants to understand the church really needs to understand how we got where we are now A church history will normally show you where each of these traditions came from and give a feeling for their nature Unfortunately I\\'m away from my library at the moment so I don\\'t have anything specific to recommend clh] ',\n",

If one takes the translation of \"this book\" in REV numbr:numbr (or somewhere around there) to mean \"all of scripture\" then all of us are likely holding something that is in violation of this command It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures even the N T ones (they didn\\'t like to date their letters I guess) I really wish I had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight but I believe that several of the N T letters chief among them numbr Peter have their most likely date of composition in the early second century A D Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of Domition (sp?) A D numbr numbr Thus it could be argues that we are all in sin if we accept numbr Peter as scripture since it was \"added\" to the book after the composition of Revelation when we are told to add nothing more If you want to get the exact dates get a copy of the New American Bible I\\'ll try to follow this up tomorrow if I remember Mike Walker email (Univ of Illinois) ',\n",

I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place As an example consider the saying in Matthew numbr:numbr + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one + and love the other or Now it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously It cannot give first priority to both One must take second place In our original example second place means that Jacob not Esau is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation and to be the ancestor of Christ Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew numbr:numbr which says of John the Baptist: + And if ye will receive it this is ELijah who was to come I take this to mean that John was an Elijah like figure dressing and living like Elijah preaching like Elijah and fulfilling the prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah I do not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense and appareently neither did he (John numbr:numbr) Yours James Kiefer ',\n",

       " 'From: email (Stephen McIntyre) Subject: Theists And Objectivity Organization: University of Nebraska at Omaha Lines: numbr Can a theist be truly objective? Can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning? I\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about God and his scriptures I\\'ve seen it in the Christian the Jew the Muslim and the other theists alike All assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists and with that belief search for their god Occasionally the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\" was behind the universe\\'s existence I\\'ve known Muslims who were once Christians and vice versa I\\'ve known Christians who were once Jewish and vice versa and I\\'ve even known Christians who become Hindu Yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher \"being \" Why? It usually all has to do with how the child is brought up From the time he is born the theist is brought up with the notion of the \"truth\" of some kind of scripture the Bible the Torah the Qur\\'an & etc He is told of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired) the scripture of the prophets talked about in the scripture of the miracles performed & etc He is also told that to question this (as children are apt to do) is a sin a crime against God and to lose belief in the scrip ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell Thus by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself the belief in its \"truth\" is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course But it doesn\\'t stop there Once the child is able to read for himself there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant readings to gloss over the worse ones and to explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery \" Circular arguments \"self evdent\" facts and \"truths \" unreasoning belief and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day To doubt of course means wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns God All of this has some considerable effect on the child so that when he becomes an adult the superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly impossible to remove All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning God Hell Heaven the angels souls and all of the rest Can he for a moment put aside this notion that God does exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view? Obviously most theists can somewhat especially when presented with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric Roman Egyptian & etc ) But can they put aside the assumption of God\\'s existence and question it impartially?

Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth To Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF numbr numbr) \" by V A Weldon and L E Fink from Boeing The paper describes a propane fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel Basically it\\'s a high speed airplane launching a Hermes type spaceplane The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the paper can launch at least numbr pounds into polar orbit or numbr pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support System design reliability is numbr Beta is a numbr foot long first stage powered by two large ramjets and numbr high speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans A numbr foot long reusable orbiter is trapeze mounted in the belly of the first stage aircraft which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage To launch the orbital vehicle the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach numbr At that point the turbofans modified to burn catalyzed JP numbr would shut off and the ramjets would take over At Mach numbr numbr the orbiter or the ELV would swing out ignite and proceed to orbit Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about numbr numbr M lbs roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An numbr The orbiter stages weighs about numbr Klbs including numbr Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two numbr Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines Propellants would be stored at numbr degrees Kelvin with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the numbr by numbr foot cargo bay and the two seat orbiter crew station LOX would be stored aft Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost a TSTO is easier cheaper and less risky to develop simpler to build has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard to handle and bulky hydrogen fuel The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel as well as its inherent self ferry capability it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline like operations as possible with a practical configuration until a single stage airbreather rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable \" >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC ? Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time I expect this or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter Does it threaten DC ??? Possibly There is a set of on going studies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space transportation strategy MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC There are various factions and options vying for attention including shuttle upgrades shuttle replacement (what was called the \"numbr numbr numbr\" architecture) SpaceLifter ELV upgrades and various advanced vehicles (ALES Beta DC ?? NASP FSTS SSTOs of several types etc ) NASA DOD DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov\\'t space transportation systems and trying to juggle near term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium term needs (including commercial considerations) and against the investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies like SDIO SSTO and NASP and Beta It\\'s a heck of a problem The worst part of the problem isn\\'t that there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts there are dozens of them but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term They should have a draft report in mid June with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor Maximus numbr numbrwb ',\n",

Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics Do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon? Not in my book Robert Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet I\\'ve seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life form I like reading science fiction as many people do But I know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to separate the fiction from the fact Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans We have several grams of the stuff in our body What\\'s it doing there? Only the Lord knows right now But I will tell you what I do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healing(and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium) Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue(collagen and elastin) There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an age related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans) For bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts A high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation This first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone A vitamin C deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing Zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing And so is silicon(in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium) For you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick But Robert I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and yes even some scientific papers) Is the explanation reasonable? Without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don\\'t know any better) If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base I\\'m inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion) If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems to make sense to me I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I\\'m going to give isn\\'t going to really mess somebody up If this makes us kindred souls Robert then I guess I\\'ll have to live with that label For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert\\'s interesting post I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U S TV I can\\'t remember the network or his name(like many nights I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup) This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\" treatments(his own words) He says that he has a numbr% success rate The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional treatment) He was going to go in and cut You guys complain about the cost of the anti fungals What do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys? I\\'m going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments? Treatments which do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?) Is it because candida blooms are not life threatening while brain tumors are? How about quality of life guys?

identified The system does not rely on registering > people as owning particular phone units > > I am against the proposal but lets be accurate in our objections > Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read The system may not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units but it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys from escrow This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal\\'s coercing or colluding use of some other person\\'s Clipper phone I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument The original title perhaps should have been \"Distinction between legal and illegal cipher systems considered harmful\" but \"Clipper considered harmful\" is not inaccurate and is more eye catching in the current context Assumptions: numbr Clipper is made available numbr Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal (either on radio systems or on any common carrier system) These laws also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio spectrum (or other medium) characterize signals validate Clipper wrappers detect probable use of non Clipper ciphers and make such detection a cause for further action numbr For escrowed keys to be useful some specific Clipper chip must be associated with a suspected criminal This means that at a minimum some association between the common carrier\\'s unique phone ID (ESN) and the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a red flag numbr To reduce ordinary fraud the cellphone system which offers Clipper will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper proof and much less spoofable than today\\'s cellphones numbr Criminals want inscrutable communications Some criminals are not entirely stupid or ignorant and will figure out both that Clipper cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably legitimate) wiretap order exists They will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone because each one has a unique unit key numbr Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves Because they are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews) and because they know that their open use of a non Clipper cipher is likely to be detected they will generally avoid using non Clipper ciphers directly on some monitorable tappable channel They know that do so would raise a red flag putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under immediate suspicion numbr It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack discover family key F and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip By #numbr #numbr #numbr and #numbr it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper phone without immediate detection Because it is difficult to obscure one\\'s association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips around the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is associated with someone else A non stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper secure communications at least for some limited time T if they buy beg borrow or steal use of someone\\'s phone in a way that prevents that person from reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T The encrypted communications might have been recorded and thus be retrievable later but the criminal can delay and quite likely evade discovery by destroying or abandoning the phone before T elapses It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper phone to someone else The honest subscriber doesn\\'t want to pay someone else\\'s bill and he doesn\\'t want to fall under suspicion This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion and collusion Coercion first Theft bears a relatively low risk but also sometimes a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from a car parked in front of a store a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen from someone who is away on vacation) Criminal commerce is likely to arise in stolen Clipper phones with phones coming from risk inured poor criminals and cash coming from risk averse wealthy criminals Someone who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of freshly coerced phones There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminals and ignorant or don\\'t care patsies who need money and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper phone service for someone else\\'s use Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non Clipper cipher to a normal cellphone They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to their stolen phone) this way The fact of a phone\\'s use being coerced must first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone and have its keys obtained from escrow Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super encryption An automated full system surveillance mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F can validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations but it cannot reveal in realtime the use of super encryption unless it knows all unit keys which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate pieces upon specific wiretap like order Whereas a criminal\\'s use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out a criminal\\'s use of a non Clipper cipher within a Clipper medium would be very difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk recordings as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper chip is fractured If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se then you can charge the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal he\\'ll be using someone else\\'s phone) but you\\'ll have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have been planning You will not even be able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more not less secure than they were before Clipper came along I therefore consider Clipper harmful because: numbr It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government numbr If other ciphers are proscribed it engenders new types of direct criminal threat to the honest public numbr It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to hide their use of some other cipher making it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress numbr If other ciphers are proscribed lazy investigators and prosecutors are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher use crime than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key escrow is claimed to help against numbr If other ciphers are proscribed the stage is set for

history as well apostasy has rarely been punished Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will However when an apostate makes attacks upon \"God and His Messenger\" the situation changes Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges perhaps charges of sedition treason spying etc If the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam the situation is likewise complicated If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation changes The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in Anyhow the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case There is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions) creates disorder makes mischief etc against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to Muslims Here a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise In other words there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange prisoners etc ) and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam It is the second situation the unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that would apply in the case of Rushdie The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book (banning the book is secondary) a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well including the deaths of many Muslims and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games > Now I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone no matter > how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law If someone tells me >

this matter is faulty > for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace > regarding this particular subject I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above I believe that one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is numbr:numbr Every verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of revelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict should be suspended when they were at war The logic does not follow In complex real life situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single complicated situation The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task It is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process There may be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed All these matters impinge on the situation In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an The Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that However if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as Sadiq(a s ) relates some of these requirements as taught by the Prophet(S A ) in a hadith: \" he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one and does not know the circumstances of revelation and does not understand the technical words of the Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the all inclusive and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those coming before them or after them then such a man does not know the Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an \" Based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic verses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn people when they return to them so that they may beware \" (numbr:numbr)) a science of jurisprudence arose The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many I\\'ve listed a few major divisions below there are of course many subdivisions within these headings Knowledge of Arabic (syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory) Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir Logic (mantiq) A knowledge of Hadiths A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an Sunnah Consensus Reasoning) The study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: discussion of imperatives (awamir) discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) discussion of unconditional and conditional discussion of tacit meanings discussion of the abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated The principles of Application of the law involves: principles of exemption principles of precaution principles of option principles of mastery The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith Now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself There is the famous hadith of the Prophet (S A ) in which he says: \"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures and wealth of this world \" The Prophet (S A ) was asked: \"O Messenger of God!

       " 'From: REXLEX fnal gov Subject: ARSENOKOITAI: Scroggs (#numbr) Organization: FNAL AD Net Lines: numbr [cont Dr James DeYoung; #numbr] R Scroggs Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a \"Hellenistic Jewish coinage perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology \" The term is derived from Lev numbr\"numbr & numbr:numbr where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\") and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\") Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (numbr n numbr) It was invented to avoid \"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (numbr) If this is true Scroggs observes it explains why the word does not appear in Greco Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it It was meaningless to native speaking Greeks (numbr) Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\" (numbr) Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a male\" to have a very narrow reference With the preceding malokoi (I Cor numbr:numbr) which Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call boy \" arsenokoitai is the active partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (numbr) Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic model of pederasty It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model he affirms (numbr) This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim numbr:numbr also The combination of pornoi (\"fornicators\") arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave dealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes males who lie [with them] and slave dealers [who procure them]\" (numbr) It again refers to that specific form of pederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes and the use of these boys by adult males\" (numbr) Even \"serious minded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom numbr Consequently Paul \"Must have had could only have had pederasty in mind\" (numbr) We cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of adult adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (numbr) In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor numbr have no deliberate intended meaning in Paul The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in the lists\" (numbr) Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices \" Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are \"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (numbr) The \"model in today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today\\'s debate They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination \" (numbr) REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D Wright In more recent years the positions of Bailey Boswell and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s view is that by David Wright In his thorough article Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai He faults Boswell for failing to cite or citing inaccurately all the references to Lev numbr:numbr and numbr:numbr in the church fathers such as Eusebius the \"Apostolic Constitutions \" Clement of Alexandria Tertullian and Origen (numbr numbr) Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (numbr) This is significant for if the term is so derived it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s claim that the first half of the word (arseno ) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half ( koitai) The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with a male \" making arseno the object Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the term including suggested parallels (numbr) Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno employ it objectively and those with arreno employ it as an adjective Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms\" (numbr) Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force the first half denotes its object and where \"the second part is substantival the first half denotes its gender\" (numbr) It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue because the former has failed to cite all the sources For example Aristides\\' Apology (c AD numbr) probably uses arrenomaneis androbaten and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality (numbr) contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus (Refut Omn Haer numbr:numbr:numbr numbr) and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor numbr:numbr and I Tim numbr:numbr (numbr numbr) Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (numbr) Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\") porneia (\"fornication\") and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris (numbr) Clement of Alexandria in Protr numbr:numbr:numbr cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as \"You shall not kill ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit adultery\") ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with boys\") you shall not steal \" (numbr n numbr) Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the Sibylline Oracles numbr:numbr numbr It may be Wright observes that the word was coined by a Jewish pre Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or Sib book numbr (numbr numbr) Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (numbrth c ) who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer in Macarius (numbrth numbrth c ) and in John the Faster (d numbr) (numbr numbr) The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse contrary to Boswell Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be absent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted (numbr numbr) Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality that some sources (e g Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (numbr numbr) Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention (numbr numbr) Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom numbr:numbr Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term Wright observes that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity\" (numbr) It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco Roman world Wright also surveys the Latin Syriac and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning \"homosexual\" i e they understand arseno as the object of the second half of the word (numbr numbr) None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited conclusion based on them Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence The term came into being under the influence of the LXX (numbr) so that writers spoke \"generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides\" (numbr) If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable it is because the former encompassed the latter (numbr) In summary Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism The views of Boswell Scroggs and others who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies [Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson After that we get into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies THis will include \"Symposium\" by Plato If there is any doubt as to the modern understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of Paul this will certainly clear things up Also we will review Paul\\'s use of Levnumbr numbr in the NT and how as for him numbr) the Law was fulfilled but not done away with numbr) Lev numbr numbr was the universal and the following chapters the general Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our culture should stick around for this one ] ___________________________ numbr R Scroggs THe New Testament and

THE PRESIDENT: Yes I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound And she described generally what the operation would be that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire In fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials There were no shots coming back from the government side I asked a number of questions The first question I asked is why now? We have waited seven weeks; why now? The reasons I was given were the following: Number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there They might be needed in other parts of the country Number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out Number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time And number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions So for those reasons they wanted to move at that time The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time The third question I asked was has the military been consulted? As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco that's the first thing I asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation Military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it And so I asked if the military had been consulted The Attorney General said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance Having asked those questions and gotten those answers I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that I would support it And I stand by that today Q Mr President THE PRESIDENT: Wait Go ahead Q Can you address the widespread perception reported widely television radio and newspapers that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? THE PRESIDENT: No I'm bewildered by it The only reason I made no public statement yesterday let me say the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold There was I have I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place I talked to her yesterday I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show and I talked to her again this morning A President it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control I will say this however I was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves (Applause ) I regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty They were heavily armed They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life They made the decision to immolate themselves And I regret it terribly and I feel awful about the children But in the end the last comment I had from Janet Reno is when and I talked to her on Sunday I said now I want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more And she said it's because of the children They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they don't think it will get any easier with time with the passage of time I have to take their word for that So that is where I think things stand Q Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn't run out of patience? And if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way? THE PRESIDENT: No well I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today This is a the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety split record time We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way Is there something else we should have known? Is there some other question they should have asked? Is there some other question I should have asked? Can I say for sure that no one that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different? I don't know that That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have There is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world And we may have to confront it again And I want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves Q Mr President were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February numbrth until yesterday? THE PRESIDENT: Well yes I got regular reports all along the way There were lots of other options pursued If you go back you all covered it very well The FBI you did a very good job of it I mean the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working Some of the children got out some of the other people left There was a at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward Whether there were other in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves That's what they thought Q Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks? Q congressional hearings once the situation are you in agreement with that? THE PRESIDENT: That's up to the Congress They can do whatever they want But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts And as I said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate There is nothing to hide here This was probably the most well covered operation of its kind in the history of the country Go ahead Sarah Q There are two questions I want to ask you The first is I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did so the children had no chance because this gas was very she said it was not lethal but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks And on February numbrth let's go back didn't those people have a right to practice their religion? THE PRESIDENT: They were not just practicing their religion they were the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws any number of them Q What federal laws THE PRESIDENT: Let me go back and answer I can't answer the question about the gas masks except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside And one of the things that I've heard I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect They also knew Sarah that there was an underground compound a bus buried underground where the children could be sent And they were I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected In terms of the gas masks themselves I learned yesterday I did not ask this fact question before that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance MS MYERS: Last question Q Mr President why are you still saying that Q Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide? And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments? THE PRESIDENT: What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen And she said and of course the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public he had that had been debated anyway And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future That was the judgment they made Whether they were right or wrong of course we will never know What happened when I saw the fire when I saw the building burning? I was sick I felt terrible And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside trying to burn themselves up That's the first thing I wanted to know Thank you Q Mr President why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision? Isn't it in the end your decision? THE PRESIDENT: Well what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four or five hour detailed briefing from the FBI I didn't go over every strategic part of it It is a decision for which I take responsibility I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call When I talked to her on Sunday some time had elapsed She might have made a decision to change her mind I said if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow I will support you And I do support her She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have Thank you (Applause ) ENDnumbr:numbr P M EDT \",\n",

Far from being \"tossed out \" the gospels are taken almost universally as the primary source of information about Jesus I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring Who \"tosses out\" the New Testament? Undoubtedly a few naive atheists do this but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why except for some naive believers (who unfortunately far outnumber nonbelievers both naive and critical) are the gospels not taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago? This has an easy answer and the answer has nothing to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text measures it by some set of criteria and then either confirms the text as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school where certain texts are vested with authority and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program In fact most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history First all texts are historically valid ALL texts Or to put this another way I have never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any sense when applied to a text Second no text should be read as telling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school NO text (This includes your favorite author\\'s history of whatever ) Every text is a historical fact Every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose Hence every text can serve as historical evidence The question is: what can we learn from a text? Of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence? The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi formerly of Oregon are historical evidence The gospels are historical evidence The letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence The modern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American figures\" are historical evidence These are all historical evidence of various things They are not much evidence at all that the Maharishi formerly of Oregon could levitate; that Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great American figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school They are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi late of Oregon levitate; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe \"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence text or otherwise evinces? This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\" as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history It\\'s relatively cheap It\\'s easy to read Give it a try Russell ',\n",

As I stated religion There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form \\'Armina\\' or \\'Aramaniya\\' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (numbr B C ) numbr The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam \\'Armeniya\\' numbr On reaching Arminam \\'Armeniya\\' numbr To the country town of Zozo to Armaniya \\'Armeniya\\' According to Karakashian: As for \\'Armenia\\' the equivalent of the \\'Armin\\' or \\'Arminik\\' of the Persians this is more recent than the word \\'Ararat\\' and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for \\'Haiastan\\' Saint Martin: The name \\'Armenie\\' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as \\'Haiastan\\' It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Ermeniyye Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\' which was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\' \\'Ar\\' refers to a place as in Ararat Archish Aruyr Archar Arshav Arazen and Aror while \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and therefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\' G Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\" is the diminutive form of \"Hai\" and that \"Hai\" is the name of our nation Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that foreigners apply to our people \\' It would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place name that \\'Armen\\' is the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way connected with the word \\'Hai\\' Haik and Haiastan: Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\' But the mere resemblance between the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof and in any case no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Khoren Haiasa: The following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the region known as Armenia Professor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper Armenia \\' Yensen in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is identical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\' in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a Hittite word Research however has proved this erroneous and shown that \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\' Mortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with no success As for Greek there is no point in even mentioning it The resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious that we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\' Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\' \\'Haikazan\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works According to Karakashian: \\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren nor is it ever found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\" Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place name (he improved and developed Haiastan etc ) If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could also have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of places \\' According to Professor Sayce who deciphered a number of Hittite inscriptions: \\'In the Hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality or species The words \"Haddanas\" \"Haddina\" were used by the Assyrians to refer to the Hittites With the transformation of the \"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this way transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\' Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory He finds however that a

Organization: Mathematics Department Memorial University of Newfoundland Lines: numbr Here's the situation: At home I have MS Word for windows but no printer At work I have windows + a postscript printer but not MS Word So I configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer and use the print to file option which produces a nice postscript file which I then bring to work My question: how do I print this postscript file through the print manager at work? If for example I select print from the file manager it treats the postscript as a text file and gives me several pages of postscript gibberish I know that I can open a DOS window and do: copy file ps comnumbr: which does work but seems not to multitask very well other applications run rather slowly and often pause for numbr's of seconds There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print Manager but if there is I can't find any mention of it in the documentation Anyone know how to do this?

Organization: UTexas Mail to News Gateway Lines: numbr NNTP Posting Host: cs utexas edu I'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response to the output from a walkman cassette player How could I do this? I don't want it just to turn on I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak per every beep I put on a cassette tape Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency? Is there any easy way to do either of these? I'm looking for the simplest circuit possible I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of color organ but not quite Let me trt to explain again I'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape So on the tape you'd hear: beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause) etc with speed increasing as time goes on I want to synchronize an LED ( probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape So the LED with each beep would go on and off real quick generating a strobe light sort of effect The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS And if there was no sound on the tape (except for background his) the LEDs would remain off Please help!

before the end of that century see the map from Abu Hakima History of Eastern Arabia numbr numbr pub numbr Al Sabah (\\'Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern Arabia According to Ahmed Abu Hakima\\'s conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between numbr numbr there was no Ottoman rule on the region ``In the second half of the numbrth century there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia In fact Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged Their attempts to restore their lost position in al Hasa through the campaign of Thuwayni in numbr and Ali Pasha\\'s expedition against the Wahhabis in numbr were unsuccessful At Kuwait the nearest point of the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra the Shaikh was under no form of Ottoman control The aim of \\'Utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the Gulf \\'\\' (p numbr numbr) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait was not a dependency of Basra the Persian occupation of Basra (numbr numbr) did not affect Kuwait \\'\\' (p numbr) Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab world This identity was clear to the British and the French who tried to win the support of Kuwait\\'s Sheikh between numbr numbr when the British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the

to an expedition carried out by the Ottomans in numbr against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields in Saudi Arabia now) Kuwait and its ruler at that time Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir allied themselves with the Turks:} Abdullah\\' role in the fighting was not a minor one He joined the expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of Al Qatif Had it not been for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet Al Qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours In relation to this a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment The answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition Because the Ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area the Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against Su\\'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone Kuwait which was not a party to the above mentioned treaty of numbr was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it [ From the above text we can see that Kuwait was not part of the Ottomans or the British colonies For more details about the mentioned expedition please check out the source of the above text: The Modern History of Kuwait numbr numbr by Ahmed Abu Hakima McGill University Canada ] Independent Kuwait numbr This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair Iraq between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al Zuhair tribe in Zubair In numbr trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the estate which was [purchased] by his father Sheikh Jabir in numbr This property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa\\'immaqam [representative] on the basis of a claim by the Al Zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n numbre Sufiyya At the same time Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian territory It should be recalled that the Turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants Abdulla Ibn Sabah the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his father\\'s agent in the case narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive Eventually the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait The decision of the Governor of Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the Turkish side and suggest that the Governor Namiq Pasha even offered him the title of Qa\\'immaqam which he declined Nevertheless the proceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair It seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the British Agent at Basra the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule Lorimer suggests that the final order of Namiq Pasha upholding the Kuwait Sheikh\\'s title to Sufiyya was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah ``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go against him had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the Wahhabi Amir \\'\\' In addition to this legal matter with Zubair Kuwait had had other problems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah as explained above However Kuwait\\'s relations with the Ottoman mutasallims of

Kuwait on a special mission from the Resident Captain Hennell His mission was to find out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a British line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the Mediterranean The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay The salute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh After Edmunds\\' return to Abu Shahr both he and Captain Hennell explained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh to have been due not to ill will but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent at Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British Therefore they considered that Jabir\\'s conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the British If the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds so also did the Egyptians Earlier in the same year some of the most wanted men in the Wahhabi camp such as \\'Umar Ibn \\'Ufaisan the Wahhabi general in Al Hasa and Wahhabi tribes like Al Duwaish sought refuge in Kuwait Protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah This can therefore be looked upon as an indication of self confidence; an outcome of Kuwait\\'s independence from foreign powers It corroborates the fact that Kuwait if necessary was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors This defense depended not only on the walls of the city but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time As to Kuwait\\'s position between numbr and numbr one can safely state that it

For those Christians who do think that some parts of Leviticus can be \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about) it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to determine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another I frankly think the whole effort misguided Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything \" But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor If you cannot go through Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy In this context it is remarkably offensive to say: >I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the >verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse Well la ti da So what? This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape I know of no one who argues seriously (though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality It is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians do raise (which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships) so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut If you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world If you want to address bestiality that is YOUR business not mine And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings You want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so Jesus and Paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to love one another and ALL else depends on that Gay and lesbian Christ ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues Christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously have never thought about maybe never even read) in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ WHY for God\\'s precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations? Is that loving your neighbor? God forbid! Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or condemn others? Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do Why for God\\'s sake? \"For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be saved through him Whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe has already been condemned for refusing to believe in the name of God\\'s only Son Now the judgment is this: the light has come into the world but men have preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil For everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come near the light for fear his deeds will be exposed But he who acts in truth comes into the light so that it may be shnumbrown that his deeds are done in God \" John numbr:numbr numbr For long ages we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do show a sinful shunning of God\\'s light Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self righteous; they shall be justified However we have seen the Truth and the Truth is the light of humanity; and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us Michael L Siemon I say \"You are gods sons of the email Most High all of you; nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall email com like any prince \" Psalm numbr:numbr numbr ',\n",

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost effectiveness The general idea is to spend money on new technology and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U S industry to invest in new technology And since our goal is to spend money it makes little sense to try to save money Of course we could always spend our money more wisely but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be It\\'s interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects GANTT charts CP M and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools Ken Jenks NASA JSC GMnumbr Space Shuttle Program Office email (numbr) numbr numbr \"A scientist can discover a new star but he cannot make one He would have to ask an engineer to do that \" Gordon L Glegg American Engineer numbr ',\n",

they are one and the same person \" (Promised Messiah p numbr) In the OT of the KJV of the Bible the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is used to refer to the true God false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel When referring to the true God \"Elohim\" is translated with a capital \"G \" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel it is translated with a small \"g \" It is translated four times as \"judges\" (Exod numbr:numbr; numbr:numbr numbr) once as \"judge\" (numbr Sam numbr:numbr) twice as \"mighty\" (Gen numbr:numbr; Exod numbr:numbr) once as \"angels\" (Ps numbr:numbr) once as \"godly\" (Mal numbr:numbr) once as \"great\" (Gen numbr:numbr) and once as \"very great \" (numbr Sam numbr:numbr) The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word \"Adonai \" Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh However since \"Jehovah\" rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism this section will also use \"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that name \"Jehovah \" unlike \"Elohim \" is never used of false gods It is the personal name of the triune God of the Bible In the KJV \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD \" sometimes \"GOD \" and rarely \"Lord \" Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders we shall consider the Apostle McConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah \" In trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ McConkie cited several verses from the Bible Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right Remember McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only \"Elohim \" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s interpretation of Ps numbr:numbr Of this verse he stated: \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit and he testified \"The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps numbr:numbr ) Two Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other Who are they and what message is contained in this Messianic prophecy? \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent or will he be as other men a mortal son of a mortal father? That he was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the Jews And so they answered \"The Son of David \" David\\'s son? Truly he was But he was more much more And so our Lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture asked \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord saying The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord how is he his son?\" That is if he is only the Son of David how is it that the great King acting under inspiration calls him Lord and worships him as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord the one who spake unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The Father said unto the Son Elohim said unto Jehovah_ sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever \\' (Promised Messiah pp numbr numbr) (emphasis added) Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ p numbr reads: \"The Lord [Elohim the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah the Son] \" (brackets in original) McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm However when one looks at the Hebrew word translated \"LORD \" it becomes apparent that either the first \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah \" Either way McConkie is wrong The Psalm reads: \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon] Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool (Ps numbr:numbr) The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says is Christ not the Father The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\" (singular for \"Adonai \" meaning master or lord) If the first \"LORD\" is the Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son then the Father is \"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon \" However if the Father is not \"Jehovah\" as McConkie claimed then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son but who then is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm and His Son is \"Adon \" Another example involves Isa numbr:numbr about which McConkie stated the following: \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness \" _Isaiah quoted the Father as saying of Christ_ \"and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles \" (Isa numbr:numbr ) (Promised Messiah p numbr) (emphasis added) McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads: \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles (Isa numbr:numbr) According to McConkie \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father and \"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ However the \"LORD\" who is speaking is \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is \"Jehovah \" Another example involves Ps numbr:numbr numbr Of these verses McConkie stated: \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him \" (Ps numbr:numbr numbr ) _The fulfillment as Jesus hung on the cross_ is found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said He saved others; himself he cannot save If he be the King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him He trusted in God; let him deliver him now if he will have him: for he said I am the Son of God The thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth \" (Matt numbr:numbr numbr ) (Promised Messiah pp numbr numbr) (emphasis added) Ps numbr:numbr numbr reads as follows: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would deliver him: let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung on the cross \" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Christ Who then was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\" the Father Another example involves Ps numbr:numbr and Ps numbr:numbr Regarding them McConkie stated the following: \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life \" (Ps numbr:numbr ) As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies the Psalmist says: \"Mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me \" (Ps numbr:numbr ) (Promised Messiah p numbr) Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and judicial trials \" We shall first consider Ps numbr and then Ps numbr While McConkie only quoted verse numbr of Ps numbr verse numbr will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life But I trusted in thee O LORD [Jehovah]: I said Thou art my God [Elohim] (Ps numbr:numbr numbr) McConkie said verse numbr referred to Jesus Christ Verse numbr goes on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His \"God\" or \"Elohim \" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is \"Elohim\" the Father Verse numbr however reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the man Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father In Ps numbr McConkie only quoted one verse; however two verses will be considered in this examination \"Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me But thou O LORD [Jehovah] be merciful unto me and raise me up that I may requite them (Ps numbr:numbr numbr) McConkie stated above that verse numbr referred to Judas\\' role in Christ\\'s death Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who \"lifted up his heel \" the pronouns \"mine \" \"I \" \"my \" and \"me\" in verse numbr must refer to Christ Notice that at the beginning of verse numbr there is a change of pronoun to \"thou \" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) Then the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again That means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps numbr:numbr \"One of the great Messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of David says: \"The Lord hath sworn and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek \" (Ps numbr:numbr ) (Promised Messiah p numbr) McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ The question is What in this verse refers to Christ? \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek (Ps numbr:numbr) Does the \"LORD \" which is \"Jehovah \" refer to Christ? If McConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah \" but the Father is not then the \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ But who then is the one addressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb numbr:numbr numbr; numbr:numbr; numbr); therefore the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps numbr:numbr is the Father Another example involves Isa numbr:numbr numbr Of these verses McConkie stated: \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah Isaiah said The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him (Promised Messiah p numbr) (emphasis added) McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah \" However what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah \" Verse numbr reads: \"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us all \" and verse numbr reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise him [Christ] \" Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\" and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these verses Remember McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity \" and that Christ \"came into mortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son He called this concept \"misinformation\" that is \"untrue \" To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth two Scriptural references (numbr Sam numbr:numbr; Ps numbr:numbr) will be examined McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures: \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic the Lord says of the Seed of David: \"I will be his father and he shall be my son \" (numbr Sam numbr:numbr ) In the second Psalm the whole of which is also clearly Messianic occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee \" (Ps numbr:numbr ) Paul quotes both of these statements in Hebrews numbr:numbr and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the Son of God (Promised Messiah p numbr) McConkie cited Heb numbr:numbr to show that numbr Sam numbr:numbr and Ps numbr:numbr refer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God \" Since McConkie first referenced numbr Sam numbr:numbr this examination will too However along with verse numbr verses numbr numbr will also be included \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies Also the LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house And when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom He shall build an house for my name and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever I will be his father and he shall be my son (numbr Sam numbr:numbr numbr) These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son the Messiah In the second example McConkie cited Ps numbr:numbr This examination will include verse numbr Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says \"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee \" \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic \" and he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of God \" What he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the \"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is Jesus Christ \"the Only Begotten \" are right in their belief Another example involves Mic numbr:numbr Of this verse McConkie stated the following: \"And so truly did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth \" (Mic numbr:numbr ) (Promised Messiah p numbr) (emphasis added) According to McConkie the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic numbr:numbr refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry \" Who then is the \"LORD his God?\" Mic numbr:numbr reads: \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD [Jehovah] in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God [Elohim] for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who is referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim \" Another example involves Ps numbr:numbr and Isa numbr:numbr Of these verses McConkie stated the following: \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord and his anointed\" (Ps numbr:numbr) signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his _Jesus applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy \"The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa numbr:numbr) and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears\" (Luke numbr:numbr) (Promised Messiah pp numbr numbr) (emphasis added) The first source McConkie quoted Ps numbr:numbr reads as follows: \"The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD [Jehovah] and against his anointed McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ If that is true who was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ who was the \"anointed\" one? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the \"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ The second source McConkie cited is Isa numbr:numbr which states: \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; The one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open was Jesus Christ Who then was the one who anointed Him? This verse says the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing Again we face the same problem If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father but only to Christ then Jesus anointed someone but who? As McConkie pointed out \"Jesus applied these passages to himself \" Therefore the \"Jehovah\" who anointed Christ is God the Father Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah \" However these should be enough to expose their error Now what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah \" but He is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah \" The following Scriptures prove this fact: \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first and I am the last; and beside me there is no God (Isa numbr:numbr) [Jesus said] I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth and was dead (Rev numbr:numbr numbr) \" saith the LORD [Jehovah] they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son (Zech numbr:numbr) Behold he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him (Rev numbr:numbr) \" I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God the Holy One of Israel (Isa numbr:numbr) Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just (Acts numbr:numbr) \"And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered (Joel numbr:numbr) \" the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved (Acts numbr:numbr) \"Behold the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand his reward is with him (Isa numbr:numbr) Behold I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me (Rev numbr:numbr) \" the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come and all the saints with thee (Zech numbr:numbr) \" at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints (numbr Thess numbr:numbr) \"The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd (Ps numbr:numbr) [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd (John numbr:numbr) \" saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah] I will seek that which was lost (Ezek numbr:numbr numbr) the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost (Luke numbr:numbr) \"For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Saviour (Isa numbr:numbr) Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ (Tit numbr:numbr See also Jer numbr:numbr and Rev numbr:numbr; Mal numbr:numbr and Heb numbr:numbr; numbr Kin numbr:numbr and John numbr:numbr numbr; Isa numbr:numbr and numbr Tim numbr:numbr; Ps numbr:numbr and Matt numbr:numbr; Prov numbr:numbr and Rev numbr:numbr) While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah \" they are wrong when they say He is not \"Elohim \" The Bible reveals that \"Jehovah\" is the only true \"Elohim\" there is; all others are false Remember \"Jehovah\" is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Bible Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" but so is the Holy Spirit \"Whereof the _Holy Ghost_ _said_ This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more (Heb numbr:numbr numbr) (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" and \"said\" added) Behold the days come _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah] that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts; and will be their God [Elohim] and they shall be my people I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more (Jer numbr:numbr numbr) (emphasis added) \"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_ (numbr Pet numbr:numbr) (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" added) \"The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me and his word was in my tongue (numbr Sam numbr:numbr See also Heb numbr:numbr numbr with Ps numbr:numbr numbr) Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses And he said Here am I [Bruce R McConkie acknowledged that \"it was\" Christ\\'s \"voice that spoke to Moses in the burning bush \" Promised Messiah p numbr] And the LORD [Jehovah] said And Moses said unto God [Elohim] Behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them The God [Elohim] of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me What is his name? what shall I say unto them?

Jer numbr:numbr) The nation whose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed (Ps numbr:numbr) Clearly this is not the \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the belief that \"Elohim \" not \"Jehovah \" is the Father of all the spirits including Jesus In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E Talmage \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles states that \"God the Eternal Father \\'Elohim \\' is the literal Parent of the spirits of the human race \" (p numbr) This \"Doctrinal Exposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth for He is one of them He is The Son as they are sons and daughters of Elohim \" (p numbr) The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_ is the name title of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ \" (Jesus the Christ p numbr) The Apostle Bruce R McConkie stated the following about this matter: \" Jehovah Christ did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof _But when it came to placing man on earth there was a change in Creators_ That is the Father himself became personally involved All things were created by the Son using the power delegated by the Father except man _In the spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the Father_ There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned \" (Promised Messiah p numbr) (emphasis added) Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah Christ\" did not create either man\\'s spirit or his body They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim \" who is the father created man both in spirit and body The Bible reveals the truth about who created man \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah] saying Let the LORD [Jehovah] the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all flesh_ set a man over the congregation (Num numbr:numbr numbr See also numbr:numbr numbr) (emphasis added) \" the LORD [Jehovah] which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and _formeth the spirit of man within him_ (Zech numbr:numbr) (emphasis added) \" the LORD [Jehovah] made us this soul (Jer numbr:numbr) \"For I will not contend for ever neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me and the _souls which I have made_ saith the LORD [Jehovah] (Isa numbr:numbr) (emphasis on \"souls I have made\" added) \"Behold I am the LORD [Jehovah] the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_ (Jer numbr:numbr) (emphasis added) \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] thy redeemer and he that _formed thee from the womb_ I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things (Isa numbr:numbr) (emphasis added) \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] I have made the earth and _created man_ upon it (Isa numbr:numbr numbr) (emphasis added) \" God [Elohim] created man upon the earth Unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the LORD [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim];

_men were made by him_; all things were made by him and through him and of him \" (emphasis added) Another error by Bruce R McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his creation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre mortal spirits helping him create Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith Jr \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from Abraham\\'s writings Unto those superior spirits Christ said: \"We will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell \" (Abra numbr:numbr numbr ) Michael or Adam was one of these Enoch Noah Abraham Moses Peter James and John Joseph Smith and many other \"noble and great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise (Doctrines of Salvation vol numbr pp numbr numbr ) (Mormon Doctrine p numbr) The Bible reveals the truth about this matter: \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things;

Deut numbr:numbr) If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the son and \"Elohim\" is god the father these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his father However as McConkie clearly stated Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father not \"Jehovah\" the son is the \"God above all Gods\" that Jesus is above all except the father; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim \" At a BYU Dev on March numbr numbr Bruce R McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus: \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed This is plain sectarian nonsense Our prayers are addressed to the Father and to him only Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father in the name of the Son; it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost (Our Relationship With the Lord pp numbr numbr) McConkie states on p numbr of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons \"pray to the Father not the Son \" On p numbr of the same book McConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah \" This is important to remember because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah \" the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to \"Jehovah \" and He not only heard those prayers but He accepted them as valid requests The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah \" \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah] and cried unto my God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears (Ps numbr:numbr) \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever;

He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the world to redeem mankind It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who \"thrash around in darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father and that Jehovah is the Son \" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim \" He apparently did not mean the D&C either because chapter numbr verses numbr numbr numbr refer to the Father as \"Jehovah \" Summary Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons \"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines of Salvation numbr:numbr) is not accurate The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and idolatry In answer to Jesus\\' question \"But whom say ye that I am \" Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles preached Therefore anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about Bernard P Brockbank of the First Quorum of the Seventy admitted in the May numbr issue of The Ensign a Mormon publication that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus He stated that \"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints \" (p numbr) The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and idolatry They do not have the Son; therefore they do not have the Father and they do not have eternal life As the Apostle Bruce R McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by worshiping the true God \" (Promised Messiah p numbr) McConkie also rightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God \" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false concepts of God \" (Mormon Doctrine p numbr) Remember that the Apostle Stephen L Richards admitted that Joseph Smith Jr gave \"a new conception of God and the Godhead \" (Contributions of Joseph Smith p numbr) It is important for the people who have left the true triune God revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him They must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism The Bible says: \" all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the LORD [Jehovah] the fountain of living waters (Jer numbr:numbr) \"And it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim] and walk after other gods [Elohim] and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish (Deut numbr:numbr) \"Thou shalt make no covenant with their gods [Elohim] (Exod numbr:numbr) \" Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you and be clean and change your garments (Gen numbr:numbr) \" flee from idolatry (numbr Cor numbr:numbr) It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible If they do they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and idolatry Remember to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life (John numbr:numbr) \" their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you \" (Ju numbr:numbr See also Exod numbr:numbr numbr) ',\n",

In any case my point is that a fear based response to Christ is not a freeing life affirming choice and isn't Good News in a meaningful sense There are plenty of good reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal hell that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between God and the Disloyal Opposition A faith based in fear is not built on Rock as we should found our faith but on ice If the fear were removed there would BE no foundation That's basically why it matters to me I think we have many Christians that DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God I cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if my response to God is motivated on fear Larry Overacker (email) Lawrence Overacker Shell Oil Company Information Center Houston TX (numbr) numbr numbr email \",\n",

Sounds like a very cool program Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point I have yet to chose a tracking method The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage I did some experiments with pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition And dancers stand still alot so their IR signature goes away The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional to the size of the warm body (or body part) and the velocity of said body This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their bodies but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the Amiga used with a LIVE! video digitizer This works with a video camera trained on the stage You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event Events can be MIDI objects or sequences Amiga sounds or graphic objects It's been fun to play with but the documentaion is arcane and the digitizer is noisy Still it's very appealing the dancers don't have to wear any appliances you can have ots of zone s it speaks MIDI which can be used to control lights and I don't have to build any electronics It's all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments I have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic but I have hopes \",\n",

On other occasions the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm For example as I pass a source the direction indicator changes The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the place When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me I can verify the source With other detectors I would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none I\\'ve had the Valentine numbr for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks Barry Barry Frishberg email Chelmsford UK Expert Center numbr TN numbr numbr Chelmsford MA ',\n",

Now if such were the case considering the relation in which as we have already seen Egypt stood to Babylon who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the Masonic art? The strong presumption is that Nimrod must have been the man He was the first that gained faim in this way As the child of the Babylonian goddess mother he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim \\'The God of Fortification \\' Osiris the child of the Egyptian Modonna was equally celebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings \\' THis strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall characteristic of Nimrod I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod as the son of Cush was a negro Now there was a tradition in Egypt recorded by Plutarch that \\'Osiris was black\\' \" Hislop It was like a cold slap to my face when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin I mean real leopard skin He told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin (The reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately repented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!) Nimr rod from Nimr a \"leopard \" and rada or rad \"To subdue \" It is a universal principle in all idolatries that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show or should I say hide this representation They however worshipped the \"spotted cow\" I\\'ll stand by my statements Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all find their source in Babylon the great harlot Sorry Peter I do not mean to be a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that Masonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt Of the Masons I have personally talked to all refered to Egypt as their origin Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago was freely admitted?

alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers pot healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply A polished ironic and amusing novel \"A Maze of Death\" Noteworthy for its description of a technology based religion \"VALIS\" The schizophrenic hero searches for the

somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late numbrth century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\" In the revised edition of \"The Existence of God\" Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie J L MACKIE \"The Miracle of Theism\" Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes Anselm Berkeley Hume et al through the moral arguments of Newman Kant and Sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational such as those of Kierkegaard Kung and Philips as well as \"replacements for God\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism The book is a delight to read less formalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand waving of Swinburne JAMES A HAUGHT \"Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care > Does being sick \"build immunity\" (leading to less illness later) > does it make kids \"weaker\" (leading to more illness later) or does it > not have any long term effect? Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity But many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production) In addition antibody levels tend to decline with time and re innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children > Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long > term effects? Yes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support) > How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than > normal and what does one do about it? Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my opinion) But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases I do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection A strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection > Is there any way to build immunity and resistance? There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents They are: protein vitamin C vitamin A iron and zinc The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem But vitamin A vitamin C iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune response Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A) There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection Serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin A status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status I have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in I can e mail you what I\\'ve worked up so far But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response You may also be able to get help from a nutritionist Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition Many Ph D programs in the U S now offer degrees in Nutrition and that\\'s what you need to look for Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests They are very good for getting general dietary advice from however > Any data information or advice relating to this would be much > appreciated Thanks a lot > > Ashwin Martin Banschbach Ph D Graduate degree in Biochemistry and Nutrition from VPI and developer of a course on human nutrition for medical students ',\n",
